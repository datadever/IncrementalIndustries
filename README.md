- A detailed quest book spanning chapters focusing on each age, starting with primitive Create machines, through to electricity, chemistry, nuclear and beyond!

- Generous quest rewards customized toward what you're currently working on in the pack.
- AE2 unlocks early-mid game to let you scale up your factory to tackle the more challenging mid-end game recipes.
- Cosmetic mods such as Chisel & Factory Block are included for all your creative needs.
- End game recipes are designed to keep you engaged and explore the mods, rather than having you go AFK for hours.
